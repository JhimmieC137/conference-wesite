# A Conference Website Project

This conference website project is a lightweight web application that consists of a Flask(Python) backend framework and a Vue.js Frontend framework. The website simply advertises and showcases features of an annual conference. Find below guidelines to set it up locally.


### Running the app
Get Node.js installed on your local machine, find help with that [here](frontend/README.md). Clone the repo using the link [https://github.com/JhimmieC137/conference-wesite.git](https://github.com/JhimmieC137/conference-wesite.git) to your local device. Navigate to the `frontend/frontend_app/` directory and run the following command in your powershell terminal:

`npm run serve`

Confirm on your browser that the website is running at `localhost:8080` or `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

For specific information on setting up, visit the [Backend](backend/RREADME.md) and [Frontend](frontend/RREADME.md) compartments.


The live app will be deployed to [hltAfrica.org](hltAfrica.org)
